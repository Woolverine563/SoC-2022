**Week 1** involved reading through sections of QCQI regarding:

# Introduction
1) The _Church-Turing hypothesis_ and the need for Quantum computation for a stronger version of the same
2) The classically inviable computation problems of **Factorization** and **Discrete Logarithms** which have polynomial-time Quantum Algorithms
3) The use of matrices to represent the states of a Quantum system and operations on it
4) Quantum Circuits, Single Qubit gates, **the No-Cloning Theorem**, Bell States
5) A basic introduction to applications of QC eg. Quantum Teleportation, Deutsch-Josza Algorithm.

# Quantum Mechanics, Linear Algebra recap
1) The equivalence of Linear Operators and Matrices
2) Bases, Linear Independence of vectors, Inner Product, Orthogonality, Gram-Schmidt procedure, Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
3) The **outer product representation** of a Linear operator
4) Hermitian conjugate / adjoint, eigenvectors
5) **Hermiticity of Projectors, Positive Operators**
6) **Spectral Decomposition** of normal matrices
7) **Tensor Products**
8) Matrix Functions for Normal matrices
9) **Polar Decomposition** for any linear operator which involves writing it as a product of a unitary and a positive operator, its extension is the Singular Value Decomposition
10) **Unitary evolution** of a closed Quantum System according to Schr√∂dinger's Equation involving a Hermitian operator, the Hamiltonian
11) The general definition of a **Quantum Measurement** as a set of operators satisfying some conditions.
